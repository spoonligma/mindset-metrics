# 🧠 Mindset Metrics

**Mindset Metrics** is a lightweight mental performance tracker for athletes. It helps student-athletes measure their focus, motivation, and emotional state — enabling better self-awareness and performance routines.

> “You can’t improve what you don’t track.”  
> Mindset Metrics gives athletes the same level of insight into their mental game as they have for their physical stats.
